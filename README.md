# ChaloVote - AI-Powered Group Travel Planning ‚úàÔ∏è

Stop the endless group chat debates! ChaloVote is an open-source web application that simplifies group travel planning. It uses AI to suggest personalized travel destinations based on everyone's preferences and a fair, ranked-choice voting system to pick the perfect spot for your next adventure.

---

## How it Works üó∫Ô∏è

ChaloVote streamlines the decision-making process into a few simple steps:

1.  **Create a Trip**: The organizer starts by giving the trip a name and adding participants' contact information (email or phone number).
2.  **Collect Preferences**: Each participant receives a unique link to a survey where they can input their travel preferences, such as budget, interests, and dates.
3.  **AI-Powered Recommendations**: ChaloVote aggregates the group's preferences and uses an open-source Large Language Model (via Hugging Face) to generate a personalized list of travel destinations.
4.  **Ranked-Choice Voting**: Everyone receives a link to a voting page where they can rank the AI-generated recommendations in their order of preference.
5.  **Declare a Winner!** üèÜ The app uses an instant-runoff algorithm to tally the votes and determine the winning destination that best satisfies the entire group.
